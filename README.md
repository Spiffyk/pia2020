## Maven

All the examples provided use Maven as a build tool. Feel free to use any other build tool but I might
not be able to help you solve any problems.

Useful resources:
* [MVN Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/) - when looking for dependencies and their versions

## Docker

[Download](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and install Docker.

Use the image defined in the [docker-tomcat](docker-tomcat/) folder. See the documentation there.

## Servlets

Java Servlet API - defines the API between the Servlet Container and the Web Application. 

See the [servlets](servlets/) folder for more information and a list of tasks.
